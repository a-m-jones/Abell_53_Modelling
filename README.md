# Abell 53 Modelling

This can be a place where I can share files and data to help with the project.

## To-do list

1) Add the outputs of the best-fit models from the MCMC procedure    
2) Clean up the pyCloudy code so that the SB profiles can be plotted    
3) Explain to Tim how it all works    

## Relevant files/folders

- /Cloudy_plotting_code/Plot_Cloudy.ipynb - has the code for plotting the SB profiles using the Cloudy output files
- /2_PhD/Abell53_Analysis/Best_models - has the outputs of the best-fit Cloudy models found using MCMC procedure
